```
A wild ride over stony ground
Such a lust for life
the circus comes to town
We are the hungry ones
on a lightning raid
Just like a river runs
like a fire needs flame oh
I burn for you
I gotta feel it in my blood whoa
I need your touch
don't need your love whoa
And I want and I need
and I lust animal
And I want and I need
and I lust animal
I cry wolf given mouth to mouth
Like a moving heartbeat
in the witching hour
I'm running with the wind
a shadow in the dust
And like the driving rain
Yeah like the restless rust
I never sleep
I gotta feel it in my blood whoa
I need your touch
don't need your love whoa
And I want and I need
and I lust animal
And I want and I need
and I lust animal huh
Oh cry wolf baby
Cry tough
Gonna hunt you like an
uh uh animal
Gonna take your love and run
<♪>
I gotta feel it in my blood whoa
I need your touch
don't need your love whoa
And I want and I need
and I lust animal
And I want and I need
and I lust animal
And I want and I want
And I need and I need
And I lust and I lust
Animal animal
And I want take me
And I need tame me
And I lust make me
Animal Your animal
And I want show me
And I need Stroke me
And I lust let me be your
Animal animal
And I want I want
And I need ooh ooh ooh
And I lust animal
Animal animal heh heh
